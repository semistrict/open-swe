"""Serve the dashboard from the backend's own origin.

A dashboard build (``ui/.output/public``: a client-only ``_shell.html`` plus
hashed assets) mounted at ``/`` lets one LangGraph deployment serve both the API
and the UI, so the browser reaches ``/dashboard/api/*`` with relative URLs and no
cross-origin cookie or CORS setup. Paths the LangGraph server owns are left to
it: the custom app's routes are matched ahead of the server's, so the catch-all
declines them instead of shadowing them. Paths are taken relative to the mount,
so a LangGraph ``http.mount_prefix`` serves the UI under that prefix as long as
the build was made for it (``DASHBOARD_BASE_PATH``).

For UI development, ``DASHBOARD_DEV_SERVER_URL`` swaps the build for a reverse
proxy to the Vite dev server, so the same origin hot-reloads. Vite's HMR
WebSocket is not proxied: the UI's Vite config points the client at Vite's own
port.
