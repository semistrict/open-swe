"""The SQL projection of one event onto the transcript read tables.

Every projection is idempotent and runs in the same transaction as the event
insert, so a reader never sees a row that the log does not explain. Where an
event accumulates (``message.appended``), the concatenation lives in the
conflict clause: the client reducer performs the same concatenation on the same
fragment, and ``message.completed`` replaces the accumulation with the
canonical text so a fragment that never arrived heals itself.

Every projection is a function of the log and the blob tables beside it —
``thread_attachment`` and ``thread_tool_output`` — and of nothing else, which
is what lets :mod:`agent.transcript.rebuild` throw a thread's read tables away
and fold them back out of its events.
