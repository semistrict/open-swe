"""The transcript read API: a windowed snapshot, older pages, an event stream, one tool output.

Nothing here calls LangGraph. A thread is authorized from the ``thread.metadata``
mirror with the same predicate the LangGraph-backed endpoints use, and a thread
with no ``thread`` row is simply not served by this API — the caller falls back
to the old read path.

Authorization and the read it guards always share one REPEATABLE READ snapshot:
a thread flipped to private is either still public in the snapshot a caller is
served, or the caller is refused — never refused-but-served the rows committed
after the flip.
