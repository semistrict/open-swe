"""The read model: one snapshot of a thread, and the log reads a subscriber needs.

Everything here reads the projections rather than folding the log, and the whole
snapshot comes out of a single ``snapshot_transaction`` — REPEATABLE READ, so
every statement sees one database snapshot and the turns, messages and tool
calls a client reduces are all consistent with ``version``. LangGraph
is never consulted: ``thread.metadata`` mirrors its thread metadata precisely so
the read path can authorize a caller on its own.
