"""Closing a turn from outside the graph: the completion webhook and cancels.

The middleware normally ends a turn itself. These helpers are the safety net for
the cases where it cannot — the process died, or the user cancelled the run —
and they only ever act on a turn that is still open. The command ids match the
ones the middleware uses, so whichever writer gets there first wins and the
other is deduplicated by its receipt.
