"""The transcript event taxonomy: one body per event type, plus the stored envelope.

Every event body carries its own ``type`` discriminator, so a payload read back
out of ``thread_event`` validates into exactly the model that wrote it. The
bodies are the wire format for the UI as well: they are dumped verbatim into
``thread_event.payload`` and streamed to the browser, which is why nothing here
holds bytes — an attachment rides as its metadata only, never as base64.
