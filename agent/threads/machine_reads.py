"""What a machine principal may read back about the threads it started.

A key and a workflow are not people: they have no viewed state, no pinned list
and no participants, and the dashboard's per-user reads are all built around
those. So they get one flat view of a thread and one flat list, scoped by the
principal id stamped on the threads they started.
