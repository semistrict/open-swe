# Local Development

Run Open SWE on your machine: the backend and the dashboard on `http://localhost:2024`, with GitHub and Slack webhooks arriving through a tunnel. Deploying it for a team is the [installation guide](INSTALLATION.md).

## Quick start

```bash
mise trust          # once per checkout: allow its mise.toml
mise run dev-init   # once per checkout or worktree
mise run dev-ui     # every time: http://localhost:2024
```

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) installs the Node, pnpm, and uv versions [`mise.toml`](../mise.toml) pins (uv brings Python) and runs every task with them; `mise tasks` lists them all. The Makefile is still there for compatibility, since each task runs the `make` target of the same name, but it is not the recommended way in: `make` uses whatever tools happen to be installed. `dev-init` installs the Python and pnpm dependencies, writes `.env` (step 5), and starts the checkout's own Postgres container. It is safe to rerun, after pulling dependency changes for instance, because it only fills in what is missing. `dev-ui` then starts the backend and the hot-reloading dashboard without repeating any of that. This is enough for the dashboard: sign-in goes through the `gh` CLI, and with no model key the agent runs on your ChatGPT subscription. The steps below add a GitHub App, Slack, and the webhook tunnel.

## Prerequisites

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (`brew install mise`), which installs uv, Node, and pnpm
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for the local Postgres
- [LangGraph CLI](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/cli) (installed by `uv sync`)
- A free [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account, so GitHub and Slack can reach your local backend (step 3)
- A Slack workspace where you may create apps, and a GitHub account or organization where you may create a GitHub App

## 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-swe.git
cd open-swe
mise trust && mise run dev-init
```

## 2. Create a GitHub App for your machine

Follow [Create a GitHub App](INSTALLATION.md#3-create-a-github-app) in the installation guide with these values, and install it on the repositories you want to test against:

- **Callback URL**: `http://localhost:2024/dashboard/api/auth/callback`. This is where GitHub sends the browser after "Sign in with GitHub" on your local dashboard.
- **Webhook URL**: `https://<name>.ngrok-free.dev/webhooks/github` with your ngrok domain from step 3, or leave the webhook off (untick **Active**) if you only start runs from the dashboard. GitHub cannot deliver to `localhost`.

Use a name of your own (GitHub App names are unique), and give it a distinct mention handle (`OPEN_SWE_MENTION_TAGS`) if a shared deployment already answers to `@openswe` in the same repositories.

## 3. Tunnel for webhooks

Always run an ngrok tunnel when starting Open SWE locally. GitHub and Slack need a public HTTPS hostname that stays the same across restarts. Reuse an existing tunnel and its exact configured domain, forwarding to the active backend (normally localhost:2024). If no tunnel is running, recover the domain from configuration or prior local runtime notes in the primary checkout before starting one; an automatically assigned hostname will not match existing webhook settings.

For a first-time setup, the free ngrok plan gives you a static domain:

1. Sign up at [dashboard.ngrok.com](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) and install the agent (`brew install ngrok`, or the download the dashboard offers).
2. Connect the agent to your account with the `ngrok config add-authtoken …` command shown under **Getting Started → Your Authtoken**.
3. Under **Domains**, claim the free static domain. It looks like `<name>.ngrok-free.dev`.
4. Start the tunnel and leave it running while you develop:

   ```bash
   mise run tunnel <name>.ngrok-free.dev   # or export NGROK_DOMAIN once in your shell
   ```

`mise run tunnel` runs `ngrok http 2024` on that domain with [`examples/ngrok/webhooks-only.yml`](../examples/ngrok/webhooks-only.yml) as its traffic policy, so only `/webhooks/*` is reachable from the internet. That restriction is not optional. Under `langgraph dev` the LangGraph API itself (`/threads`, `/runs`, `/assistants`, `/store`, …) has no authentication at all: the dashboard API checks its session cookie and the webhook endpoints check their signatures, but anyone who can reach port 2024 can read and create threads and runs. A tunnel that forwards the whole port publishes exactly that. Everything except the webhooks stays on `http://localhost:2024`, where you keep opening the dashboard. Check the policy once the backend is up (step 6): `curl https://<name>.ngrok-free.dev/webhooks/slack` answers `{"status":"ok", …}` from the backend, while `/ok` gets ngrok's own 404.

Preserve the existing webhook traffic policy. For local Slack OAuth, also preserve the callback relay: requests to `/dashboard/api/slack/callback` on the ngrok domain must redirect to `http://localhost:2024/dashboard/api/slack/callback` with the complete query string intact. The stock webhooks-only policy blocks this path, so reuse the local policy containing that redirect when Slack OAuth is configured. The callback is a redirect to localhost; dashboard pages and API routes must remain inaccessible through the tunnel.

## 4. Create a Slack app for your machine

Slack delivers events to one URL per app, so a local backend needs its own Slack app rather than the one a shared deployment uses. Follow [Create the Slack app](INSTALLATION.md#5-create-the-slack-app) in the installation guide with your ngrok domain from step 3, `<name>.ngrok-free.dev`, as `<your-url>` (the manifest supplies the `https://`), and give it a name that says it is yours, for example `open-swe-<you>`; the bot's handle follows from it. Copy the four values it lists into `.env` in the next step.

Slack checks the events Request URL against a running backend. If you create the app before the backend is up, open **Event Subscriptions** afterwards and press **Retry**. The same applies whenever you change `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: restart the backend, then Retry.

## 5. Write `.env`

`.env` in the repository root holds the local configuration; `langgraph dev` loads it. `mise run dev-init` creates it: in a worktree it copies the primary checkout's `.env`, keys and app credentials included, and otherwise it starts from [`.env.example`](../.env.example). It then fills in whichever of these are empty, and never overwrites a value:

- `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (a new Fernet key) and `DASHBOARD_JWT_SECRET`
- `ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS` and `CONFIGURED_ADMINS`, set to your `gh` login
- `OPEN_SWE_OPENAI_OAUTH_TOKEN_FILE`, when no model provider key is set (see below)

Add the GitHub App values from step 2 and the Slack values from step 4 to it. `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` is one double-quoted line with `\n` between the PEM lines, and `SLACK_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is your domain from step 3.

**Local sandboxes.** `.env.example` sets `SANDBOX_TYPE=local`: runs execute on your machine, unisolated, since `langsmith` sandboxes need `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` and a public dashboard URL. `mise run dev` and `dev-ui` give each checkout its own `LOCAL_SANDBOX_ROOT_DIR`, `sandbox/` in the checkout's state directory below, so worktrees never share clones and no run works inside the checkout, which is the provider's default. Threads of one backend still share that root.

**ChatGPT subscription instead of an API key.** With `OPEN_SWE_OPENAI_OAUTH_TOKEN_FILE` set and no `OPENAI_API_KEY`, OpenAI models (the default without an Anthropic-only setup) run on your ChatGPT plan through the Codex backend. The file is a `langchain-openai` ChatGPT token store, and the backend refreshes it in place. `mise run dev-init` points it at the store Deep Agents Code signs in to (`~/.deepagents/.state/chatgpt-auth.json`) when that exists, and at `~/.langchain/chatgpt-auth.json` otherwise; `mise run chatgpt-login` signs in and writes it. Never point it at `~/.codex/auth.json`: rotating its refresh token signs the Codex CLI out.

`LANGGRAPH_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:2024`, and `DASHBOARD_BASE_URL` / `DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL` default to it, so none of the three is needed locally. Keep them on localhost when setting `SLACK_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the tunnel. You only need one model credential: either a provider key or a gateway key if you route model calls through an LLM gateway, such as the [LangSmith Gateway](INSTALLATION.md#4-model-providers-and-api-keys). How the running model is chosen is covered in the same section. Linear, if you use it, comes from the [Linear](INSTALLATION.md#linear) section of the installation guide, with your ngrok domain as the URL.

Open SWE needs a PostgreSQL database for its own tables, and `langgraph dev` does not provide one: it keeps LangGraph's threads and Store in memory, so the platform's Postgres is not there locally. Every checkout gets its own: `mise run dev-init` claims a loopback port from 54320 up that no other checkout uses, and `mise run dev` and `dev-ui` start that checkout's `postgres:16` container and point `POSTGRES_URI` at it. Worktrees therefore never share users, settings, or migration history, so a branch that adds a migration cannot break another checkout's startup. Its state lives outside the checkout in `~/.open-swe/<checkout>-<hash>/`: `postgres-port`, the data directory `postgres/`, and the local sandbox root `sandbox/`. Removing the container keeps the data; deleting that directory, after removing a worktree for instance, discards it. `mise run postgres` starts the container on its own and `mise run postgres-down` stops it. Set `POSTGRES_URI` to skip the container and use any database you can create schemas in — see [Analytics storage](INSTALLATION.md#1-create-the-deployment) for what startup migrations create there, including the `repository`, `users`, and `workspace` tables.

With a database, every thread created from then on is also recorded into the append-only transcript event log and its LangGraph metadata is stamped `transcript: v2`. The dashboard reads recorded threads from this log by default for everyone. Threads with agent turns from before recording started are never recorded and always read LangGraph state.

`TEST_ANALYTICS_POSTGRES_URI` is the same thing for the test suite, and only for it: the tests that exercise those tables migrate one template database per test process, clone a throwaway database from it for each test, and drop both afterwards. The role therefore needs `CREATEDB`; the `postgres` superuser of a throwaway container is simplest (`docker run -d -p 5439:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres postgres:16`, then `postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5439/postgres`), or grant it with `ALTER ROLE <user> CREATEDB`. Use a separate server from the one `mise run dev` uses. Unset, every such test skips rather than fails, so a run without it proves less than it appears to; CI sets it, so a regression in that code is caught there either way.

## 6. Run

`mise run dev` and `dev-ui` refuse to start while something else listens on port 2024, and names the process. When switching worktrees, stop the previous backend gracefully and wait for it to release port 2024 before starting the replacement. Each worktree has its own [local state](#local-state-across-worktrees).

```bash
mise run build-dashboard   # Vite build into ui/.output/public
mise run dev               # langgraph dev on http://localhost:2024, serving the API and the dashboard (starts the Postgres container first)
```

`langgraph dev` serves the graphs, the FastAPI app, and the dashboard build together on port 2024. The bundled UI is a static build, so rebuild it when you pull UI changes, or skip `build-dashboard` if you only need webhooks and the API. It reloads on code changes only: after editing `.env`, restart it.

**Working on the UI?** Have the backend front the Vite dev server instead of serving a build:

```bash
mise run dev-ui   # Vite on :3000 and the backend on :2024 forwarding UI requests to it, in one terminal
```

`dev-ui` runs `web` and `dev` side by side, the backend with `DASHBOARD_DEV_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000`; Ctrl-C stops both. Open `http://localhost:2024` as usual: the page, its modules, and hot module replacement come from Vite, while `/dashboard/api/*` and the LangGraph routes stay with the backend. Nothing else changes, because the browser never leaves port 2024. The HMR WebSocket connects straight to Vite's port; the UI's Vite config points the client there.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Dashboard |
| `POST /webhooks/github` | GitHub issue, PR, and comment webhooks |
| `POST /webhooks/slack`, `POST /webhooks/slack/interactivity` | Slack events and Block Kit interactions |
| `POST /webhooks/slack/commands` | The `/oswe` slash command |
| `POST /webhooks/linear` | Linear comment webhooks |
| `GET /dashboard/api/auth/login`, `GET /dashboard/api/auth/callback` | GitHub login |
| `/dashboard/api/*` | Dashboard API |
| `GET /ok`, `GET /health` | Health checks |

> `mise run fastapi` serves the FastAPI app alone with uvicorn on port 8000, without the LangGraph runtime. Nothing that creates runs works there; use `mise run dev`.

## 7. Verify it works

Before reporting readiness, verify `/ok` on localhost, open the dashboard in a browser, and check tunnel forwarding and the OAuth callback redirect. A healthy `/ok` does not mean the UI is ready: `mise run dev` needs a dashboard build or a running Vite server to serve it.

**Dashboard.** Open `http://localhost:2024`, click **Sign in with GitHub**, and you should land logged in. With your login in `CONFIGURED_ADMINS`, the **Admin** pages appear. Set **Admin → Global defaults → Default Repository**, then start a task from the composer.

**Slack.** With the tunnel running and the Request URL verified, invite your bot to a channel and mention it: `@open_swe_you what's in the repo?`. It replies in a thread; ngrok's inspector at `http://localhost:4040` shows the event arriving.

**GitHub.** With the tunnel running and the App's webhook pointed at it, comment `@openswe what files are in this repo?` on an issue in a repository where the App is installed. Within a few seconds you should see a 👀 reaction, a run in your LangSmith project, and a reply comment. GitHub-triggered runs act as the commenting user, so that account has to have signed in to your local dashboard once. The App's **Advanced** tab lists every delivery and its response, and ngrok's inspector at `http://localhost:4040` shows what arrived.

With only the seeded `default` workspace, Slack and GitHub runs land there by default. Create additional workspaces from the **Workspaces** page to exercise routing locally: the same order applies as in a deployment (thread, `workspace:<slug>` tag on the opening message — `env:<slug>` remains an alias, owning repository, bound Slack channel, user default, then `default`); see [How a run picks its workspace](INSTALLATION.md#7-verify-it-works) in the installation guide.

**Incidents.** Follow [Incidents setup](INSTALLATION.md#incidents) to enroll Slack channels. Set `SLACK_APP_ID`; anyone in a channel can pause or complete its incident, and asking the agent requires a connected Open SWE account. Incident turns run on the main `agent` graph and are dispatched straight from the Slack webhook, so `mise run dev` or `dev-ui` is all that is needed.

Record the worktree, process IDs, fixed tunnel domain, and state location in ignored `logs/local-dev/` notes in the primary checkout so the next session can reuse them.

## Backend API documentation

[`swagger.json`](../swagger.json) is the generated OpenAPI 3.1 schema for the custom FastAPI backend (`agent.webapp:app`). Import it into an OpenAPI 3.1-compatible viewer. After local setup, `mise run fastapi` serves interactive documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs` and the live schema at `/openapi.json`; this server does not include the LangGraph runtime or support creating runs.

Regenerate the checked-in schema with `mise run swagger` after changing backend routes or models. The checked-in file can lag the running backend; use its live schema when inspecting deployed routes. Some request/response schemas and authentication requirements are not yet documented. LangGraph runtime endpoints such as `/runs`, `/threads`, and `/assistants` are not included.

## Local state across worktrees

Every checkout keeps its own local state, and a new worktree starts clean:

- `.langgraph_api/` in the checkout, where `langgraph dev` persists threads, checkpoints, and the Store
- `~/.open-swe/<checkout>-<hash>/`, with its Postgres container's port and data and the local sandbox root (see step 5)

The two halves belong together: a thread's transcript is recorded in Postgres, so threads copied into another checkout without their database open with no history. [`.worktreeinclude`](../.worktreeinclude), which [Codex-managed worktrees](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/environments/git-worktrees#copy-ignored-local-files-into-managed-worktrees) read when they are created, therefore seeds only `.env`, and `mise run dev-init` copies `.env` from the primary checkout for worktrees made with `git worktree add`. Removing a worktree leaves its `~/.open-swe` directory and stopped container behind; `mise run postgres-down` in the worktree first, then delete the directory.

## Sign in locally with the `gh` CLI

The dashboard's per-user reads — the PR list, one PR's details, a PR preview — run on the signed-in person's own OAuth token, and the `gh` CLI already holds one. `GET /dashboard/api/auth/dev-login` stores it and mints the session, so a machine-local GitHub App (step 2) is only needed for the App-backed endpoints. With no `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID` configured, **Continue with GitHub** redirects here on its own; `/dashboard/api/auth/dev-login?redirect_to=/agents/reviews` skips the page.

It is refused with a 404 outside `langgraph dev`, which is the only runtime reporting the `local_dev` API variant, and the `ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS` allowlist still applies — set it to your own login. `DASHBOARD_JWT_SECRET` signs the session.

What still needs the App, and answers `503 GitHub App token unavailable` without one: a published review and its diff, inline review comment reads and writes, and the webhook flows. The reviews list and each PR's preview read as you, so they work.

The `local-gh-dev` skill in `.claude/skills/` walks through the whole loop, including the port and Postgres conflicts between worktrees.

## Dashboard on the Vite dev server directly

`mise run dev-ui` is the simple way to develop the UI. Opening Vite on `http://localhost:3000` directly also works:

```bash
mise run web      # Vite on http://localhost:3000, proxying /dashboard/api/* to DASHBOARD_API_URL (default http://localhost:2024)
```

The browser now talks to `http://localhost:3000`, so the session cookie has to be set on that origin and the login callback has to return there:

```bash
DASHBOARD_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"       # the frontend origin; allowed for the CSRF check and post-login redirects
DASHBOARD_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"   # what browsers use for /dashboard/api/* and the OAuth callback
```

and the GitHub App needs `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/api/auth/callback` as an additional callback URL. Keep both URLs on `http://` locally so the cookie is `SameSite=Lax`. `DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` lists **additional** origins that may call the API with credentials; credentialed CORS is only enabled when it is set, and `*` is rejected.

## Dashboard against a deployed backend

`pnpm run dev:prod` runs the Vite dev server, hot reload and all, against a deployment instead of a local backend — UI work against real threads, repositories, and settings without running the agent locally. Put the deployment in `.env` (step 5's file, gitignored):

```bash
DASHBOARD_API_URL=https://your-deployment.example.com   # a preview deploy, not production
```

then `pnpm run dev:prod`. There is no default, because a fallback would be someone else's production. `DASHBOARD_API_URL` in the environment overrides the file, and it is the only key read out of `.env`: the rest of it is the local backend's secrets, which have no business in the environment of a dev server the browser talks to.

The first run opens your browser to sign in. That leg still runs against the deployment's own registered GitHub callback — nothing changes on the GitHub App, and nothing changes on the deployment. It is the PKCE loopback handoff the desktop app uses (`?desktop_handoff=…&desktop_port=…`): the deployment redirects your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback` with a code that lives 120 seconds, and the script exchanges it at `/dashboard/api/auth/desktop/exchange` for a session. That tab then waits for Vite and sends you on to the dev server, so signing in ends where you want to be. The session lasts a week and is cached in `~/.cache/open-swe/dev-session.json`; after that you sign in again.

The dev server then attaches that session to everything it proxies, and presents the deployment's own origin so its CSRF check accepts mutations. **The session is real.** A task started from `http://localhost:3000` is a real run on that deployment, and the Admin pages edit its real settings.

`pnpm run build`, `pnpm run typecheck`, and `pnpm run test` run across the workspace through Turborepo (`pnpm --filter open-swe-dashboard run <script>` scopes one); `pnpm run lint` (oxlint) and `pnpm run format` / `pnpm run format:check` (oxfmt) run once from the root over every JS and TS file.

## Test a PR in preview (LangChain maintainers)

The shared [preview environment](https://open-swe-preview-cc53e8fbe667565d843d0843f84ee92c.us.langgraph.app/agents) combines `main`, `preview-manual`, and open PRs labeled `preview` whose branch lives in this repository (anyone with write access; a fork's code stays out); it is not an isolated deployment per PR. (Note: staging follows `main` and is for post-merge testing.)

1. Add the **`preview`** label to your PR.
2. Run [Deploy open-swe preview](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainplus/actions/workflows/deploy_open_swe_preview.yaml) on `main` with **force** unchecked, or wait for a scheduled run at :04, :19, :34, or :49 each hour. Labeling alone does not deploy.
3. In the run summary, confirm your PR and head commit appear under **Preview tree → Merged**, not **Skipped**. A successful run may still omit a PR.
4. Wait for the run's **Deploy the preview tree** job. It rolls the preview deployment to the published `preview` commit and fails, with the revision's build or server logs, unless the revision deploys.
5. Open [preview](https://open-swe-preview-cc53e8fbe667565d843d0843f84ee92c.us.langgraph.app/agents) and test with non-production tasks and repositories. For local UI iteration against that backend, see [Dashboard against a deployed backend](#dashboard-against-a-deployed-backend).

When PRs conflict with the preview tree, the run makes one `oswe` call (an Open SWE agent on the backend in the `OPEN_SWE_BACKEND_URL` repository variable) that merges all of them; the summary marks those PRs `conflicts resolved by oswe`, and later runs replay the resolution from a git rerere cache. PRs the agent cannot resolve are skipped, unlabeled, and receive resolution instructions for the shared `preview-manual` branch. Resolve the conflict before reapplying the label. Use **force** only to rebuild an unchanged preview tree.

The label stays on through pushes: each push to a labeled PR rebuilds the preview with its new head.

To remove a PR, remove its label and trigger or await another run; the current deployment remains until its replacement deploys, and changes in `main` or `preview-manual` remain. Every seven days, a scheduled run between 07:00 and 07:59 `America/New_York` resets preview to `main`, removes labels, and deletes `preview-manual`.

## Desktop app (experimental)

The Electron app in `desktop/` includes the compiled dashboard UI. Run it next to the backend:

```bash
mise run dev                  # terminal 1
mise run desktop              # terminal 2
```

Development connects to `http://localhost:2024`. For a hosted backend run `pnpm --dir desktop run start -- --backend-url=https://your-backend.example.com` or set `OPEN_SWE_BACKEND_URL`. `pnpm --dir desktop run pack` creates an unpacked application and `pnpm --dir desktop run dist` an installer. Packaged builds ask for the organization's backend URL on first launch and never default to the maintainers' deployment. The GitHub App must allow `<backend-url>/dashboard/api/auth/callback` for desktop login.

## Capturing UI jank (flinch)

Some UI problems are easier to react to than describe: a frame of a loading state, a row that jumps, a logo that blinks out. Dev builds of the dashboard record the page continuously and keep the last ~30 seconds. When something feels off, press **Alt+Shift+F** (a "flinch"), and that window is saved to `logs/flinches/`: an [rrweb](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb) DOM recording plus the browser's layout-shift, long-frame, slow-interaction, network, and console signals on the same clock. An agent driving the browser can flinch on purpose with a note: `await window.__openSweFlinch.flinch("what I was doing")`.

```bash
mise run flinch                 # the newest flinch
mise run flinch -- path/to/flinch.json --before 6000 --fps 60
```

`flinch` replays the recording in headless Chromium and writes, next to the file:

- `report.md`: what changed on screen around the flinch (elements on screen for under 300 ms, remounts, text and attribute flips, layout shifts, long frames, slow interactions, console errors), each at its frame number
- `frames/` and `sheets/`: labeled frames and contact sheets of consecutive frames, for reviewing images
- `slowmo.mp4` and `video-review.md`: the frames as slow motion (10× by default), reviewed by a video model through OpenRouter (`google/gemini-3.8-flash` by default, `--model` to change it) against the taste spec, using `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `~/.openrouter/api_key`; `--no-video-review` skips it

The replay loads images and fonts from the dashboard's origin, so keep the dev server running while analyzing.

The [`ui-jank`](../.agents/skills/ui-jank/SKILL.md) skill is how agents use this: they read its taste spec, [`TASTE.md`](../.agents/skills/ui-jank/TASTE.md), before changing the UI, flinch the flows they touched before calling a change done, and turn each confirmed flinch into a fix and a lesson in the spec.

## Profiling thread load and streaming

The dashboard records two performance spans, in every build, with the same code path locally and in production (`ui/src/lib/perf/`):

| Span | Starts | Steps | Ends |
|---|---|---|---|
| `thread_load` | The navigation to `/agents/:threadId` (or the document's time origin on a full page load, `cold=true`) | `detail` (thread summary, `GET /threads/:id`), `hydrate` (SDK state fetch, `GET /threads/:id/state`), `paint` | First frame after the transcript rendered |
| `agent_run` | Pressing send (`joined=true` when the run was started elsewhere, e.g. a queued message) | `accepted`, `stream_open`, `first_event`, `generation_start` (first assistant message, so the run is visibly producing thinking or a tool call), `first_text` (first streamed assistant text) | The run's streaming phase ends (`reason`: success, error, interrupt, stopped) |

Each span carries attributes: request time-to-first-byte and the backend's `Server-Timing` phases for the detail and state requests (`detail_srv_thread_get_ms`, `state_srv_get_state_ms`, …), whether the detail came from the sidebar cache, message and chunk counts, time spent in `streamMessagesToUi` (`build_ms`), protocol event and text-delta counts, the lag between the server's event timestamp and receipt (`lag_avg_ms`, includes clock skew, read as a trend), and, in development builds only, React commit time for the transcript while streaming (`commit_ms`).

**Locally.** Spans print to the console in dev builds (`[perf] thread_load 812ms — detail 120 · hydrate 640 · paint 812`). Open a thread with `?perf=1` for an overlay listing recent spans with a copy-as-JSON button (`?perf=0` hides it again; the flag persists in `localStorage`). `window.__openSwePerf.spans()` and `.export()` return the same data for scripts and Playwright. Every span is also a User Timing mark and measure named `osw:*`, so it appears on the Timings track of the Chrome Performance panel next to long tasks and network requests, which is where to look once a span says *what* is slow. Compare cold and warm loads separately (`cold`, `detail_cached`), and reload a few times per change: single samples are noisy.

**In production.** With Datadog RUM configured, ended spans are sent as custom duration vitals named `thread_load` and `agent_run`, attributes in the vital context and `client` (`web` or `desktop`) in the global context. Abandoned spans (navigated away, hydration failed) stay local only. The backend side of the same picture is the `Server-Timing` header on `GET /dashboard/api/threads/{id}` and `/state` (logged as `thread state timings`) and the `open_swe_dashboard_thread_ttft` histogram, which measures the same thing as `first_text` rather than the first token of any kind.

For "how long until the agent answers", read `@context.step_generation_start_ms`; `@context.step_first_text_ms` sits after the opening tool calls and is much larger.

**Desktop diagnostics.** Installed builds keep *View → Toggle Developer Tools* and add *Help → Save Diagnostics Report…*, which writes the renderer's recent console output, the main process's warnings, app and OS versions, and the exported perf spans to a text file, with session cookies, bearer tokens and provider keys redacted. Ask users to attach that file to a report.

## Tasks

`mise tasks` lists every task with its description; these are the ones you will reach for. Each runs the `make` target of the same name, which still works for compatibility but uses whatever tools are installed rather than the pinned ones.

| Task | What it does |
|---|---|

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook not receiving events

- The tunnel must be running (`mise run tunnel`) against port 2024, and the URL in GitHub or Slack must be your ngrok domain. Do not swap in a tunnel that forwards the whole port; see step 3. GitHub shows each delivery under the App's **Advanced** tab; ngrok's inspector at `http://localhost:4040` shows what arrived. With the webhooks-only policy, ngrok itself answers 404 for anything outside `/webhooks/*`, so test with `/webhooks/slack`, not `/ok`.
- Restart the backend after changing `.env`: `langgraph dev` reloads on code changes only, so a new `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` or `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` is not picked up until then, and every delivery is rejected as `Invalid signature` in the meantime. Slack then needs **Retry** on its Request URL under **Event Subscriptions**.
- Webhook secrets are required: without `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, or `LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, every request to that endpoint is rejected with 401.

### Dashboard login fails or won't stay logged in

- `redirect_uri is not associated with this application`: the App must list `http://localhost:2024/dashboard/api/auth/callback` (or the `:3000` one when you open Vite directly). Add it in the App's settings.
- Login redirects but the session does not stick: keep local URLs on `http://` so the cookie is `SameSite=Lax`.
- `DASHBOARD_BASE_URL not configured` on Sign in with Slack or Notion: the backend has neither a dashboard build nor `DASHBOARD_DEV_SERVER_URL`, so it does not know where the dashboard is. Run `mise run build-dashboard` or use `mise run dev-ui`.
- Admin pages 403: add your GitHub login or email to `CONFIGURED_ADMINS`.

### Dashboard shows the LangGraph JSON instead of the UI, or 404s at `/`

- There is no dashboard build: run `mise run build-dashboard`, or use `mise run dev-ui`.
- With Vite on port 3000, `curl -i http://localhost:3000/dashboard/api/me` should return the backend's `401`, not HTML; otherwise export `DASHBOARD_API_URL` before `mise run web`.

### `Port 3000 is already in use`

`mise run dev-ui` and `mise run web` refuse to start when another Vite is still running (Vite is configured with `strictPort`). Stop the old one or check `lsof -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN`.
