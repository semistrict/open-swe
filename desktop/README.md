# Open SWE Desktop

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This desktop client is experimental. The web UI is the recommended way to use Open SWE.

The Electron package ships the compiled Open SWE web UI. Users configure only the URL of a
compatible Open SWE backend; they do not need a separately hosted dashboard.

Desktop users can choose **This Mac** in the new-task composer to run the same Open SWE LangGraph agent over a selected local project. Electron owns a loopback-only LangGraph server, proxies it to the bundled UI, and stops it with the app. Local threads use the same streaming protocol, graph, tools, subagents, and middleware assembly as cloud threads; only the filesystem backend and unavailable cloud integrations differ.

The composer's workspace selector chooses where a local thread runs. **Current checkout** (the default) runs the agent in the project directory itself, on whichever branch the branch picker selects. **New worktree** gives the thread its own git worktree, checked out from the selected base branch on a placeholder `open-swe/local-<id>` branch that the agent renames after it reads the request — so your own checkout is never touched and up to ten local threads can run at once without contending for a working tree. Deleting a thread removes its worktree along with anything uncommitted in it. Only one agent may work in a given tree at a time, so starting a thread in a checkout another agent is running in, or switching that checkout's branch under it, is refused.

The packaged app bundles its Python runtime and locked Open SWE dependencies. Source development uses `uv run langgraph dev`. Provider credentials stay in the local LangGraph process and are not inherited by agent shell commands. Added projects and local thread history are persisted in the desktop app's local data. Thread checkpoints are committed to a SQLite database there rather than to `langgraph dev`'s periodically flushed pickle files, so quitting or killing the app does not lose thread history.

For local OpenAI models, the app can use either `OPENAI_API_KEY` or a ChatGPT subscription. When no
API key is configured, sending the first local task opens the system browser for ChatGPT sign-in.
OAuth credentials are encrypted with the operating system's secure storage, refreshed by Electron,
and made available to the local model client through an authenticated loopback broker. Refresh
tokens are never placed in the local backend environment or inherited by agent shell commands.

Local model calls also honor `LANGSMITH_GATEWAY_*` configuration. On managed macOS installs, the
app reads `LC_GATEWAY_KEY` from `launchctl` when no explicit gateway key is configured and enables
gateway routing for the local backend. The local backend traces to the connected cloud deployment's
`LANGSMITH_PROJECT` by default. Gateway and provider credentials are not inherited by agent shell
commands.

The side panel's **Changes** tab diffs the project against a git snapshot taken when the session
started, so it shows what the agent changed and not the working tree's prior state. It also shows
the workspace's branch and discovers its pull request when the GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated.

## How it connects

The bundled UI runs at an internal `open-swe://app` origin. Electron proxies its
`/dashboard/api/*` requests to the selected backend, so the browser never receives a LangSmith API
key and never calls the raw LangGraph API directly. GitHub login creates the same signed dashboard
session used by the web UI.

Packaged builds ask for the organization's backend URL on first launch and store it in the app's
local user data. They have no maintainer-hosted default. Use **Open SWE → Backend URL…** to switch
deployments; switching clears the previous deployment's local session data.

The shared backend's GitHub App must allow `<backend-url>/dashboard/api/auth/callback` as a
callback URL. Set `ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` or `ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS` on that backend to control which
GitHub users can create cloud dashboard sessions. The desktop app's private local backend does not
require GitHub or either allowlist.

The desktop sign-in screen also offers **Continue in local mode**. This skips GitHub sign-in and
limits the Agents workspace to projects and threads on **This Mac**; cloud threads, settings, and
other account-backed features remain behind sign-in. The choice is remembered on that computer,
and **Sign in for cloud mode** remains available from the local sidebar.

## Install on macOS

Install Git, [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (which brings Node.js, pnpm, and `uv`), and
[Bun](https://bun.com/docs/installation), clone this repository, then run this from its root:

```bash
mise trust && mise run install-desktop
```

The command fast-forwards to the latest `main`, builds Open SWE Desktop, and installs it in
`/Applications` (or `~/Applications` when needed). Run it again to update and replace the app; saved
backend settings, login sessions, and projects are preserved.

## Local development

Set up the checkout once with `mise run dev-init`, then run the backend, desktop app, and web UI independently:

```bash
# terminal 1
mise run dev

# terminal 2
mise run desktop

# terminal 3 (optional web UI)
mise run web
```

`pnpm run dev:desktop` is equivalent to `mise run desktop`. The matching `make` targets still work for compatibility. The desktop app starts its private local-agent backend on a random loopback port while connecting cloud features and GitHub login to the shared backend at `http://localhost:2024`.

Source launches use an isolated `Open SWE Development` Electron profile, so the dev app can run
beside an installed `Open SWE` app without sharing its login session, backend configuration,
projects, or single-instance lock. The dev window is labeled **Open SWE Development**; its first
launch may require signing in and adding projects again.

A separate agent installation is not required. Confirm `uv --version` succeeds before starting the desktop app in development.

Development defaults to `http://localhost:2024`. Point to another backend with:

```bash
pnpm --dir desktop run start -- --backend-url=https://open-swe-api.example.com
```

`OPEN_SWE_BACKEND_URL` provides the same override. Resolution order is command-line argument,
environment variable, saved first-launch configuration, then the local development default.
The original `--url` and `OPEN_SWE_DESKTOP_URL` names remain accepted for compatibility.

## Packaging

```bash
pnpm --dir desktop run pack # unpacked application for the current platform
pnpm --dir desktop run dist # installer for the current platform
```

Both commands build `ui/` and package its static output with Electron. Build outputs are written
to `desktop/dist/`.

`pack:development` packages "Open SWE Development" (`com.langchain.openswe.dev`): the development
profile in a real app bundle, signed with whichever Developer ID identity is in your keychain.
Unlike `electron . --dev`, macOS gives it its own entry under Notifications, so run notifications
can be tried locally. It shares the development profile's backend and session, takes no updates,
and leaves out Universal Links, which need LangChain's provisioning profile. electron-builder
notarizes it when `APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE` names a `xcrun notarytool store-credentials` profile for
the same team:

```bash
APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE=<profile> pnpm --dir desktop run pack:development
```

## macOS releases

`desktop/package.json` is the latest stable version. Every **Promote main to prod** run publishes a
prerelease nightly from the promoted commit with a UTC timestamp, such as
`desktop-v0.2.3-nightly.20260902080000`. Nightly releases never publish the stable version.

Stable releases use a deliberate bump, test, release process: bump `desktop/package.json` in a normal
pull request, merge it to `main`, test the resulting code as needed, then run **Release Desktop**
manually. The workflow publishes the exact package version and fails if that stable release is
already complete. A partial stable release remains manually retryable.

Both paths compile the current `ui/` bundle, sign and notarize the Electron app, verify the resulting
app and DMG, create the tag, and publish the DMG, macOS zip, and app zip. Desktop-prefixed tags keep
this release stream separate from web and backend releases; the workflow packages the web UI but
does not deploy or otherwise change the hosted web app.

The workflow requires these GitHub Actions secrets:

- `APPLE_SIGNING_CERT`: base64-encoded Developer ID Application `.p12` certificate
- `APPLE_SIGNING_CERT_PASSWORD`: password for the certificate
- `APPLE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`: base64-encoded Developer ID provisioning profile for
  `com.langchain.openswe` with Associated Domains enabled (required for Universal Links)
- `APPLE_API_KEY`: App Store Connect `.p8` key contents
- `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`: App Store Connect key ID
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER`: App Store Connect issuer ID

Local packaging remains available without those credentials; signing and notarization are performed
by the release workflow.

## Deployment security

The backend URL is public configuration, not a credential. Dashboard routes require an
`osw_session` cookie issued after GitHub login, and `ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` or
`ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS` controls who may complete that login. CORS alone is not access control.

Raw LangGraph routes are a separate boundary. A deployment using `LANGGRAPH_AUTH_TYPE=noop` must
keep those routes behind a private network, authenticated gateway, or custom LangGraph auth. An
external user does not need the deployment's server-side `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` to call an exposed,
unauthenticated LangGraph route.
